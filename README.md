A [Moment.js](https://github.com/moment/moment) plugin for handling holidays at scale.

## Another holiday library?

With [date-holidays](https://github.com/commenthol/date-holidays) and [kodie's moment-holiday](https://github.com/kodie/moment-holiday), there are two alternatives
to `@nesto-software/moment-holiday`. We want to improve the existing approaches by providing a high-performance solution for enterprise Node.js backends.

As we found out, there are a lot of challenges in providing a library which covers most business needs in the B2B sector.
We face customers who want to bring in their own holidays.
In order to do so, we provide database integration and a caching strategy to reduce the impact of database queries whenever possible.
[Click here](https://nesto-software.github.io/moment-holiday/#/concepts.md?id=caching) if you are curious how we do it.

For a list of currently supported countries, [click here](https://nesto-software.github.io/moment-holiday/#/README?id=supported-countries-states-regions). 
If your country is missing, we want to encourage you to add your locale bundle by [submitting a PR](https://nesto-software.github.io/moment-holiday/#/CONTRIBUTING?id=submitting-a-pr).

> Our main focus is on Node.js as we think that it is most effective if holidays are managed centrally and exposed through a REST API. However, there is [browser support](https://nesto-software.github.io/moment-holiday/#/browser) if you want
to use this library in the frontend.

## Features

- 🚀 Built for Node.js and Browser
- ⚡️️ Simple, Powerful, & Intuitive API
- 💪 Typings using TypeScript
- 🔥 Better Performance using Function Caching
- 🇩🇪 🇦🇹 Multiple countries, states and regions
- 📑 Database Support for Custom Holidays
